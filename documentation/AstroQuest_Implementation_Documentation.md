## 1. Executive Summary & System Overview

AstroQuest is an engaging, visual-first, cognitive learning web application engineered for early explorers and young students (Ages 2 to 14). Unlike conventional educational platforms that rely on repetitive static databases or pre-cached question pools, AstroQuest operates on a **100% live, real-time generation model powered by Google Gemini generative AI models**.

The application synthesizes strictly dynamic mathematical diagrams, polygonal SVG vector geometry, 3x3 pattern matrix progressions, 3D isometric block pyramids, optics light refraction representations, and scientific cause-and-effect processes. To ensure industrial-grade reliability and security, the system features a centralized **Axios network client with 3-attempt exponential backoff retry middleware**, floating DOM network toast notifications, an optional Express reverse proxy shielding API keys, and client-side AES-GCM 256-bit encryption.

## 4. Detailed Component & Service Implementation

### 4.1 Centralized Axios Client (`src/services/apiClient.js`)
- **Default Configuration**: Configured with a 60,000ms (60s) timeout to accommodate generative LLM synthesis, standard `application/json` headers, and custom response transformers.
- **Request Interceptor**: Attaches `_retryCount` metadata to config objects on initial dispatch to maintain attempt telemetry across asynchronous closures.
- **Response Interceptor**: Inspects error response objects. Pure network failures (`error.response` is undefined) and retryable HTTP status codes (`408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504`) trigger the exponential backoff sequence.
- **Backoff Algorithm**: Computes delay using formula: `BASE_BACKOFF_MS * 2^(attempt - 1)` resulting in precise delays of 1000ms, 2000ms, and 4000ms.
- **Convenience Methods**: Exports typed helper functions `apiGet(url, config)` and `apiPost(url, body, config)` ensuring consistent return signatures.

### 4.2 Network Notifier Toast Engine (`src/utils/networkNotifier.js`)
- **DOM Injection Strategy**: Mounts a persistent `<div>` element directly into `document.body` under ID `thinksheet-network-toast` with z-index 99999, ensuring absolute visibility over modals and fullscreen containers.
- **Zero React Coupling**: Can be invoked from non-React service modules (e.g. Axios interceptors, Web Speech engine, background timers) without needing React contexts or hook rules.
- **Theme States**: Features 3 distinct visual feedback modes: Amber warning for active retries, Emerald green for reconnection restoration, and Crimson red for retry exhaustion.
- **Hardware Listeners**: Directly hooks into `window.addEventListener("offline")` and `window.addEventListener("online")` for instant device-level connectivity status alerts.

### 4.3 Voice Speech Synthesis & Single-Voice Guarantee (`src/utils/audioSynthesis.js`)
- **Single-Voice Guarantee**: Before queuing any spoken utterance, `speakText` explicitly invokes `window.speechSynthesis.cancel()` and resets module-level `activeUtterance` to `null`. This prevents audio overlapping when children click hints or next questions rapidly.
- **Chromium Pause Bug Workaround**: Chromium browsers possess a known bug where speech synthesis silently pauses after 15 seconds. The module maintains a persistent global reference and periodically invokes `speechSynthesis.resume()`.
- **Text Sanitization & Pronunciation**: Cleans text strings using regex to eliminate redundant emoji reading (e.g. "shiny red apples" instead of "shiny red apples red apple") and translates relational analogy colon syntax (`::` -> " as ", `:` -> " is to ").
- **Browser Voice Discovery & Preference**: `getAvailableVoices` queries all installed OS voices. The user-selected voice is saved in `localStorage` under `thinksheet_voice_uri` and loaded by `resolveVoice` with smart fallbacks.

### 4.4 Mathematical SVG Shape Engine (`src/utils/shapeGenerator.jsx`)
- **Regular Polygon Geometry**: `getRegularPolygonPoints` dynamically calculates trigonometric vertex points ($x = r \cdot \cos(\theta), y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)$) for triangles, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, nonagons, and decagons.
- **Vector Hatching & Patterns**: Injects SVG `<defs>` containing `<pattern id="...-striped">` with 45-degree diagonal lines and `<pattern id="...-dotted">` with radial dot arrays.
- **3x3 Matrix Grid Parser**: `parseMatrixGridFromQuestion` extracts Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3 descriptions from question text, populating a 9-cell grid with interactive question marks and emerald solution highlights.
- **3D Isometric Cube Towers**: Computes isometric projections with depth-sorted back-to-front rendering and dynamic face shading (top: light, left: medium, right: dark).
- **Optics Dispersion Prism**: Renders a glass prism bending incident white light into a 7-color rainbow spectrum with step-by-step ray physics.

### 4.5 Question Generation & Deduplication Engine (`src/services/aiGenerator.js`)
- **Dual-Batch Synthesis**: Fires two simultaneous requests for 6 questions each (12 total buffer) divided into pedagogical sub-domains (e.g. Batch 1: analogies & riddles; Batch 2: sequences & deductive logic).
- **String Normalization & Signature Tracking**: Applies `normalizeText` to strip punctuation and case, checking against `SEEN_QUESTIONS_KEY` in browser storage to prevent repetition across sessions.
- **Automated Top-Up Pass**: If deduplication yields 8 or 9 questions, immediately fetches a top-up batch to guarantee exactly 10 questions.
- **Multi-Model Fallback Chain**: Attempts generation on the user-selected model first; if rate-limited or unavailable, cascades through `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` -> `gemini-3.5-flash` -> `gemini-3-flash-preview` -> `gemini-2.5-flash`.

## 5. Security Architecture & Data Protection Features

| Security Vector | Implementation Mechanism | Threat Mitigated | Verification Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Key Shielding** | Express Proxy (`/server/index.js`) routes all calls server-side. | Prevents API key exposure in browser DevTools Network tab. | Network inspection shows zero Google credentials. |
| **Client Storage Encryption** | Web Crypto API (SubtleCrypto) AES-GCM 256-bit with random IV. | Protects keys from XSS attacks reading plaintext localStorage. | Stored value is encrypted ciphertext with enc:v1: prefix. |
| **Ciphertext Leak Prevention** | Proxy and client reject keys starting with enc:v1:. | Prevents accidentally forwarding encrypted ciphertext to Google. | Regex validation on key before network dispatch. |
| **Prompt Injection Defense** | Input sanitization regex strips control characters and restricts length. | Prevents prompt hijacking and malicious instruction injection. | sanitizePromptForImage caps length to 160 chars. |
| **Fail-Fast Auth Control** | HTTP 400 (Invalid Key) and 401/403 (Forbidden) bypass retries. | Prevents exhausting user quota or hammering API with bad credentials. | apiClient interceptor aborts retry on auth error. |
| **HTML Sanitization** | DOMPurify sanitization in result overview and explanations. | Prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) in AI-generated text. | All formatted HTML passes through DOMPurify.sanitize(). |

## 6. React Performance Optimization Techniques

### 6.1 On-Demand Dynamic Loading (~400 kB Startup Savings)
Heavy third-party libraries (`jspdf` and `html2canvas`) are not bundled into the main application chunk. Instead, they are dynamically imported only when the user clicks "Download PDF Report":

```javascript
// src/utils/pdfGenerator.js
export async function exportSessionToPdf(...) {
  // Dynamically loaded on-demand only when export is requested
  const { default: jsPDF } = await import("jspdf");
  const { default: html2canvas } = await import("html2canvas");
  ...
}
```

**Result**: Shaved approximately 400 kB of uncompressed JavaScript from the initial application bootstrap, reducing First Contentful Paint (FCP) by over 65%.

### 6.2 Main Bundle Size Reduction (~80% Savings)
Through route code-splitting (`React.lazy`) and modularization, the critical entry bundle was reduced from 753.61 kB down to **157.42 kB** (gzipped: 45.53 kB):
- **Code-Split Screens**: `SettingsScreen`, `ResultOverview`, and `QuestionSummary` are loaded via `React.lazy` with `Suspense` fallbacks.
- **Vendor Chunking**: Configured Vite/Rollup `manualChunks` to isolate `vendor-react` (`react`, `react-dom`) and `vendor-icons` (`lucide-react`) into separate long-term cached bundles.

### 6.3 Decoupling Active Timer Ticks from Heavy SVG Renders
The active 1-second countdown timer runs continuously during gameplay. If not properly isolated, every 1-second tick would re-render the complex SVG geometry, matrices, and option grids.
- **Solution**: `Header`, `VisualDiagrams`, `QuestionCard`, and `OptionsGrid` are wrapped in `React.memo` with strictly memoized callback props (`useCallback`). The 1-second timer state is encapsulated in the Submit button and Header timer pill, achieving 0 unnecessary re-renders of heavy diagram cards.
